 * when defining a class

 *   - Superclass (if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the
 *                       keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
 *   - Interfaces (if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, 
 *                       preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
 *   - Body: The class body is surrounded by braces, { }.

     * the method declaration consists of six components:

     *         * private: Accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
     *         * default (declared/defined without using any modifier): Accessible within the same class 
     *           and package within which its class is defined.
     *         * protected: Accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es)
     *           (including subclasses declared outside the package).
     *         * public: Accessible in all classes in your application.
     *  - The return type: The data type of the value returned by the method or void if it does not return a value.
     *  - Method Name: The rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.
     *  - Parameter list: Comma-separated list of the input parameters that are defined, preceded by their data type, 
     *    within the enclosed parentheses. If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().
     *  - Exception list: The exceptions you expect the method to throw. You can specify these exception(s).
     *  - Method body: It is the block of code, enclosed between braces, that you need to execute to perform your intended operations.
